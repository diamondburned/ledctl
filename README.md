# ledctl

[Jon Bright's ledctl](https://github.com/Jon-Bright/ledctl), but far more
idiomatic and clean.

This module does not contain the `ledctl` program supplied by the original
author. It only contains a `ledctl` package for controlling the LEDs on a
Raspberry Pi.

## Changes

- Far more idiomatic and clean API
- More performant by properly using `uint8` and color types
